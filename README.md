# Kaggle-Projects
This repository shows my Kaggle projects in which different Machine Learning algorithms had been implemented.

## Projects:

1. **[Brain Stroke Prediction ANN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zzettrkalpakbal/full-filled-brain-stroke-dataset/data)**  
   - Used <b>ANN (Artifical Neural Networks)</b> to do prediction of brain stroke with accuracy of 95%
   - Data visulaization and preprocessing has been done before defining model.
   - Binary classification algorithm 
   - [Notebook Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adiefo/brain-stroke-simple-ann)

2. **[Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)**  
   - Bulit machine learning(deep learning) model to predict MRI images in correct classification group 
   - <b>CNN(convolutional neural networks)</b> has been used
   - Multi classification problem

3. **[California House Price](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price)**  
   - Performed data visualization for more accurate data
   - Using <b>supervised machine learning</b> algorithm to predict the final price of house in California
   - <b>Linear Regression</b> algorithm implemented in two different approaches
